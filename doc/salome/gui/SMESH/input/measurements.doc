\page measurements_page Measurements

Mesh module provides the possibility to perform different measurements
of the selected mesh data.

All measurement operations are available via \b Measurements
top-level menu. Access to the measurements operations is
implemented via a single dialog box, where each operation is represented
as a separate tab page.

\section min_distance_anchor Minimum Distance

This operation allows measuring the distance between two objects.
Currently only node-to-node and node-to-origin operations are
available, but this operation will be extended in the future to support
other mesh objects - elements, meshes, sub-meshes and groups.

To start <b>Minimum Distance</b> operation, select <b>Minimum Distance</b>
tab in \b Measurements dialog.

Choose the first and the second target by
switching the corresponding radio buttons, then select the objects the distance
between which is to be calculated (or input their IDs directly 
in case of nodes/elements) and press \b Compute button.

The following targets are supported:
- \b Node: single mesh node;
- \b Element: single mesh element (not available in this version);
- \b Object: mesh, sub-mesh or group object (not available in this
version);
- \b Origin: origin of the global co-ordinate system.

The result will be shown in the bottom area of the dialog. In addition, a simple
preview will be shown in the 3D viewer.

\section bounding_box_anchor Bounding Box

This operation allows calculating the bounding box of the selected
object(s).

To start <b>Bounding Box</b> operation, select <b>Bounding Box</b>
tab in \b Measurements dialog.

Choose the required type of the object by switching the corresponding radio button, select the object(s) and press \em Compute button.

The following types of input are available:
- \b Objects: one or several mesh, sub-mesh or group objects;
- \b Nodes: a set of mesh nodes;
- \b Elements: a set of mesh elements.

The result of calculation will be shown in the bottom area of the
dialog. In addition, a simple preview will be shown in the 3D viewer.

\section basic_properties_anchor Basic Properties

This operation provides calculation of length, area or volume for the the selected object:
- \b Length is calculated as a sum of lengths of all 1D elements;
- \b Area is a sum of areas of all 2D elements
- \b Volume is a sum of volumes of all 3D elements. 

To start a <b>Basic Properties</b> calculation, select <b>Length</b>, <b>Area</b> or <b>Volume</b> item.

\image html basic_props.png

In the dialog box select the required type of calculation (length, area or volume) and the object (mesh, sub-mesh or group) and press \b Compute button.

The result of calculation will be shown in the bottom area of the dialog.

\note
- If the mesh consists of 3D elements only, its "length" and "area" will be 0.
- As calculation result is a sum of lengths, areas and volumes of all mesh elements, the
  duplication is not taken into account; i.e. all duplicated elements
  (elements built on the same set of nodes) will be included into the result.
- Similarly, intersection of elements is not taken into account.
