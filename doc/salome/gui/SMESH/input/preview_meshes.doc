Before whole mesh computation it is allowed to see the mesh preview.
When mesh object is already created and all hypotheses assigned,
select your mesh in the <b>Object Browser</b>. From the
\b Mesh menu select \b Preview or click "Preview" button of the
toolbar or activate "Preview" item from pop-up menu.

The Mesh Preview dialog box appears. In this dialog box you can select
preview mode <b>1D mesh</b> or <b>2D mesh</b> depending on assigned
hypotheses to mesh. 

The 1D mesh preview shows as nodes computed on geometry edges

The 2D mesh preview shows edge mesh elements, computed on geometry faces

Pressing <b>Compute</b> button leads to whole mesh computation
process.
During exit from Preview dialog box, the question about storage temporary
created mesh elements appers:
