\page clipping_page Clipping

\b Clipping allows creating cross-section views (clipping planes)
of your mesh.

It is available as a sub-item in the context menu of an active mesh. 

To create a clipping plane, click on the \b New button in the dialog and choose how it is  defined: by \b Absolute or \b Relative coordinates.

<b>Absolute Coordinates</b>

- <b>Base point</b> - allows defining the coordinates of the base
  point for the clipping plane.

  - <b>Reset</b> - returns the base point to coordinate origin.

- <b>Direction</b> - allows defining the orientation of the
  clipping plane.

	- <b>Invert</b> - allows selecting, which part of the object will be
    removed and which will remain after clipping.
    
<b>Relative mode</b>

- \b Orientation ( ||X-Y, ||X-Z or ||Y-Z).

- \b Distance between the opposite extremities of the boundary box of 
selected objects, if it is set to 0.5 the boundary box is split in two halves.

- \b Rotation (in angle degrees) <b>around X</b> (Y to Z) and <b>around 
Y</b> (X to Z) (depending on the chosen Orientation)

The other parameters are available in both modes : 

- <b>OpenGL clipping</b> check-box allows choosing OpenGL native clipping, which clips the whole presentation. If it is unchecked, the clipping is done on the dataset i.e. only the visibility of separate mesh cells is changed (see the examples).
- The List contains <b>Meshes, sub-meshes and groups</b> to which the cross-section will be applied.
- <b>Select all</b> check-box allows to selecting and deselecting all available objects at once.
- <b>Show preview</b> check-box shows the clipping plane in the <b>3D Viewer</b>.
- <b>Auto Apply</b> check-box shows button is on, you can preview the
cross-section in the <b>3D Viewer</b>.

It is also possible to interact  with the clipping plane directly in 3D 
view using the mouse. 

To get a new object from \b Clipping, click \b Apply.
