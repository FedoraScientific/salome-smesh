\n Using this menu you can create cross-section views (clipping planes)
of your mesh.

To start, click on the \em New button.

Now you must specify what mode of creating plane you want to choose: 
absolute or relative.

<b>Absolute mode</b>

- <b>Base point</b> - allows to define the coordinates of the base
  point for the clipping plane.

  - <b>Reset</b> - returns the base point to coordinate origin.

- <b>Direction</b> - allows to define the orientation of the
  clipping plane.

  - <b>Invert</b> - allows to select which part of the object will be
    removed and which will remain after clipping.
    
<b>Relative mode</b>

- \b Orientation ( ||X-Y, ||X-Z or ||Y-Z).
- \b Distance between the opposite extremities of the boundary box of 
selected objects, if it is set to 0.5 the boundary box is split in two halves.
- \b Rotation (in angle degrees) <b>around X</b> (Y to Z) and <b>around 
Y</b> (X to Z) (depending on the chosen Orientation)

The parameters of cross-section: 

List of <b>meshes, sub-meshes and groups</b> to which the cross-section will be applied.

<b>Select all</b> button allows to select and deselect all available
objects at once.

If the <b>Show preview</b> button is on, you can see the clipping plane
in the <b>3D Viewer</b>.

Also there the possibility to interact directly with the clipping plane in 3D 
view with mouse. User can change the parameters of clipping plane by dialog data 
or by hand.

If the <b>Auto Apply</b> button is on, you can preview the
cross-section in the <b>3D Viewer</b>.

Also, it is possible to specify the type of clipping: using dataset, 
i.e. it only changes the visibility of separate mesh cells or alternative 
clipping - an OpenGL native one, which clips overall presentation.
For choosing use <b>OpenGL clipping</b> checkbox.
